                          <h2>Tweeter Malicious Bot Detection</h2>
                          <hr class="star-primary">
                          <div class="modal-text">

                                Bots on Twitter are accounts that are controlled by computer programs, automatically producing content, and interacting with other accounts. These programs are turned on and off without following a pattern, making them hard to identify. Some bots only exist for providing some interesting tweets to users daily, but some bots are intentionally spreading disturbing or misleading information, which negatively impacts users’ experiences. Those malicious bots indirectly hurt Twitter’s image and business revenue. Although Twitter has already been able to identify most of the bot accounts, the company could have done better in Malicious Bots Classification. Therefore, this project propose a novel bot type classification method by using TFIDF. With the supervised machine learning method, this study aims to detect malicious Twitter bot types based on bot behaviors and text analysis.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>BIG PICTURE</b><br>
                                During the modeling process, the primary source of input data is bots' IDs from Bot Repository. I use Python to crawl users'information and tweets based on these IDs. <br>
				The process is divided into two phase. In phase one, I start off with features extraction with Tweeter's metadata then tested multiple supervised machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression with IBM SPSS Modeler platform to create testing model with 13 significant indicators to predict behaviors of certain malicious bot types. In phase two, to further improve on the result, I created a dictionary for each type of malicious bots and calculated the TFIDF of keywords in the dictionary of each tweet. Then I again applied the most accurate model from phase one with additional TFIDF features. Finally I got a Random Forest that can predicted malicious bots correctly of 91.68% on the testing set.<br>

                                <b>BASELINE MODEL</b><br>
                                To start off with the baseline model, I first gained interest of using behavior patterns as prediction targets from multiple research papers. The selection includes three major malicious bots: Fake Follower, Scam Bot, and Spam Bot.
				The raw data set includes 900 IDs for each kind of malicious bots from Bot Repository, reaching 2,700 IDs in total. From 2,700 IDs, I used Twitter API and Tweepy to crawl twitter's metadata and tweets. Since some accounts have been banned and might not have any tweet, I got 2,042 valid account and crawled 250 tweets for each account. In total, there are 138,042 tweets for Fake Followers, 160,245 tweets for Scam Bots, and 161,956 tweets for Spam Bots.<br><br>
				
				<b>PHASE ONE - BAD BOT-LIKE BEHAVIOR DETECTION</b><br>
				In phase one, typical features of tweet syntax, temporal behavior and user profile are used to build a model that identifies different types of malicious bots. After testing multiple models, I decided to use Random Forest since it results in the highest accuracy rate. For your information, Random Forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decision tree. I used IBM SPSS to build an uncorrelated forest of trees to predict the type of malicious bots based on 13 identified fields of account's behaviors. The features include user ID for each twitter account, average number of retweets of tweets for each account, average number of times tweets favorited by twitter users for each account, bot type, bot group, number of followers, number of friends, number of tweets for each account, a binary feature of default profile (yes/no), a binary feature of using default profile image, if geo-location is turned on, average number of tweets posted daily per account, and percentage of tweets containing URL or hyperlink for each account.<br>
				The target of the Random Forest model is bot group, which containing three nominal values of Fake Followers, Scam Bots, and Spam Bots. The data was partitioned into 70% of the training set and 30% of the testing set. The Random Forest test classified malicious bots with a high level of accuracy, 99.43% correctly on training data, and 91.05% on testing data. Since the training set may be overfitting, I focused on the testing set. Regarding the testing set, the model performed best at predicting Spam Bots, with accuracy of 96.226%, following by Fake Followers and Scam Bots, with accuracy of 89.862% and 87.019%, respectively. Overall, the Random Forests can be applied to classify malicious bot types with the features above at a high level of accuracy. <br>
                                The Random Forests Classification applied nine predictor inputs to train 1405 records, which is 70% of the dataset. The result indicated that some features matter more than others. Pertaining malicious bot behaviors classification, the model identified the most important predictor as average of retweet count, following by number of followers, average daily tweet, number of tweets, number of friends, percentage of tweets containing URL or hyperlink per account. Using the default profile, the average number of favorites and turning on geo-location do not demonstrate significant results for classification.<br><br>
				
				<b>PHASE TWO - BEHAVIORAL FEATURES AND TEXT SEMANTICS DETECTION</b><br>
				In phase two, I used Python package NLTK to get keywords dictionary and frequency of each keyword for 216,173 tweets. I calculated every term's frequency for each group of malicious bots. I set he threshold for term frequency rate is 0.05%. I picked every term with that is larger than the threshold to create detection dictionaries for fake followers, scam bots, and spam bots. To calculate fitting degree of each tweet with three dictionaries, I used Python and Excel to calculate they keywords' TFIDF in each tweet and see whether these dictionaries contribute to our prediction. Finally, I normalized TFIDF of each tweet to make sure they are under the same weight then calculated the average normalized TFIDF of each account. Wordcloud are used to check the term frequency, and the results of Word Cloud were consistent with the TFIDF calculation.<br><br>
				In short, Fake Followers have the lowest TFIDF score in all three dictionaries and a little better match in Fake Follower dictionary, probably due to their small number of tweets. Scam Bots are in the middle, and Spam Bots have high TFIDF in all three dictionaries and especially in the spam dictionary. Spam Bots do post tons of tweets, and the result indicates that there are some words in the spam dictionary that have discriminative power to distinct Spam Bots from other bots. We added these three average TFIDF as our new features in our detection model and built a new model to see whether these three new features can contribute to our overall accuracy.<br>
                                The Random Forest Classification applied 12 inputs as predicting factors to train 1405 records again. The dataset was partitioned into 70% of the training set and 30% of the testing set. Adding three new inputs of average TFIDF scores of Fake Followers, Scam Bots, and Spam Bots, the model produced a new list of important indicators. The top three indicators now are average of retweet count for each tweet, the number of followers, and average TFIDF score of the spam bot. According to the result, the TFIDF score plays a significant role in classifying types of malicious bots. This new model predicted malicious bots correctly of 91.68% on the testing set.<br><br>
				    
	
                                <b>EVALUATION</b><br>
                                In general, the model of phase two performed slightly better than the model of phase one based on the comparison of accuracy. I can’t tell whether it’s due to the new features or the random error. However, one thing I am sure about is that the TFIDF certainly contributes to analyze the bot types as the model could predict correctly of 81.16% on the testing data when I only used these three features to detect different kinds of malicious bots.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
                                In this project, I combined supervised machine learning and natural languague processing to classify different types of malicious bots on Twitter. After intensive research of related works, I found out that even though most of them researched about bot identification, and even though some of them also studied malicious bots identification, none of them use keyword detection.<br><br>
				This project targets on malicious accounts' tweets as a means to build keyword dictionaries. Both detection tools are more and more advanced, but bots are also becoming more human-like, which makes them more complicated to detect. I focus on finding features related to natural language. <br><br>
				In phase two, I trained a Random Forest classifier using the features of average TFIDF score of keywords in each type dictionary. I was able to create a multi-class classifier that performs with 91.68% of accuracy when classifying into one of 3 classes.<br><br>
				Overall, Fake Followers are inactive accounts with the highest score of TFIDF_fake, Scam Bots are also inactive accounts but with high retweet counts and the highest score of TFIDF_scam, and Spam Bots are active accounts with the highest score of TFIDF_spam. Besides, I can predict Spam Bots the best using the TFIDF score since TFIDF_spam is in the top three important indicators of the model.

                                Many of these side projects that I did encompass my personal interest: Wine and dining, biking, and the financial market. There's nothing I love more than being able to apply what I do for work and what I learn in school to a topic that people care about, to make machine learning and statistics less scary and more accessible. Something that we could all relate to.

                                <b>1. Grubhub vs. Uber Eats Twitter Sentiment Analysis</b><br>
                                I crawled tweets mentioning Grubhub and Uber Eats on Twitter using tweepy to perform EDA and sentiment analysis to compare the popularity between the two food delivering services in said area, thereby offering insights on products and service improvement for both businesses. 
                                An analysis for Seamless might not be as easy due to its generic name, making it hard to distinguish between content.<br>
                                Comparing the tweets mentioning each service, Grubhub has more positive sentiment percentage than Uber Eats.
                                I zeroed in on particular geographic location (Greater New York Metropolitan area) and analyzed other competitors (often also mentioned in the tweets), major customer complaints, most popular foods and restaurants for each service, and visualized analytics result.

                                I love Citi Bike. If you live in New York City you must know that it feels absolutely wonderful to bike around Central Park and by the Hudson river in the fall. It's like you're in a movie and that anything is possible.  
                                So I took this large dataset released by Citi Bike and did some modeling with it, hoping to get some insight.<br>

                                I tested out Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression models using Python and SPSS Modeler to predict riders’ trip duration with an 61% of accuracy.
                                They could improve their pricing strategy of surcharging and reducing the free period for subscribers to fall closer to trip duration.<br><br>

I hope that one day I could retire early and live off my passive investment income.

                                I did this as a weekend project, stemming from my own curiosity to what the expert sommeliers have to say about different wines in different parts of the world (because who doesn't love wine?). I applied sentiment analysis, several text parsing methods like stop-word removal and n-grams to discover the pattern of these reviews.

                                <br><br>
                                April 11, 2019.
                                <br><br>
                                This past Monday saw the 2019 NCAA Men’s Basketball Champion – Virginia Cavaliers, after beating Texas Tech in overtime. It was a heart-throbbing experience for me personally watching the championship game, especially during that 5-minute overtime, or when the main game stood at a tie (68-68).
                                <br><br>
                                    I was extra thrilled for this year's tournament as my classmates and I competed against 35 other teams in the March Data Crunch Madness competition held by Fordham University Business Analytics program and sponsored by Deloitte, mirroring Google Cloud & NCAA annual competition – Applying Machine Learning to NCAA March Madness.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I would not get into the technicality of the model that we built as it’s worth a separate post, but rather focus on general takeaways that I have learned from the competition and the tournament:
                                    <br><br>
                                    1. The name ‘March Madness’ holds true. Biggest Elite Eight upsets in tournament history.
                                    <br><br>
                                    2. Perseverance and redemption: UVA earned this championship. Did you know that in 2018 March Madness, top seed UVA was out in the very first round by losing to seed 16 UMBC?
                                    <br><br>
                                    3. Yet luck is still a major component for Virginia Cavaliers. Top seed Duke lost to Michigan State in Elite Eight (67-68), alas.
                                    <br><br>
                                    4. Predicting bracket is a personal journey. Be it your college’s team, your hometown, your dog picked the bracket, or your unwavering support for the underdogs. To each their own, we all have our own methodology to predict the bracket. For my team, we simply let the data speak. We wholeheartedly trusted the model and did not alter our code even when we favored a losing team. Our log loss came out to be 0.49.
                                    <br><br>
                                    5. Some important variables that play a big role in predicting the bracket:<br>
                                    - Team seed<br>
                                    - Final and Preseason AP Poll Ranking<br>
                                    - Coach Poll ranking before the final (Here’s an interesting Tableau visualization on college basketball coaches’ salary)<br>
                                    - Opponent's shooting percentage on 3 point field goals<br>
                                    - Points scored per 100 offensive possessions<br>
                                    - Estimate of offensive efficiency & Estimate of defensive efficiency (especially how one factor offsets the other factor of the opponent in a game - classic offense vs. defense in basketball)
                                    <br><br>
                                    6. You might think the fanciest machine learning model will be the most optimal option. Well, think again. The devil is in the details. Getting the bracket right requires a good understanding of basketball, statistics, creativity in engineering new features, ability to grid search and tune your hyperparameters, and ultimately, luck. Winners of first year's Kaggle March Madness competition published a paper detailing their method, using good ol' logistic regression. Personally, my team tested a few simple models and went with Random Forest Classifier.
                                    <br><br>
                                    7. Power of visualization and story-telling. No matter how fancy the machine learning model might be, ultimately it comes down to the Final Four prediction (which only 0.02% of people got it right this year) and the ability to explain the model and findings to judges, who may or may not come from technical background, be an avid basketball fan, or love a good Tableau visualization. FiveThirtyEight (one of my favorite data-driven news sources) did a fantastic job once again with its 2019 march madness bracketology project including an interactive visualization here.
                                    <br><br>
                                    8. Some other interesting techniques that I observed from other participating teams:<br>
                                    - Introduce numbers of NBA draft per team as a variable<br>
                                    - Incorporate legal sport betting data into the model as a variable<br>
                                    - Use ‘Dark Horse’ analogy to predict upsets<br>
                                    - Apply genetic algorithm to the model
                                    <br><br>
                                    9. Fun fact: My team's prediction for Elite Eight and Final Four matches exactly with the prediction of Adobe Analytics.

                                    10. Limitation:<br>

                                    - Time and resources, or lack thereof: We did not have much time to say, deploy fancy models or come up with more creative features, or simply to beautify our codes just a little bit more. There's always another tournament the following year ...<br>
                                    - The model built is based heavily on features team seed, AP Ranking, and Coach Ranking. There should be a random noise feature added to account for upsets, especially in the last few matches.<br>
                                    - Bias in machine learning models: Models are black boxes. Even with an adequate understanding of the fundamental maths behind them, there's room for mistakes and biases. By assessing several methods to evaluate a model and keeping an open mind, only then can we commit to reducing biases.<br>
